# Student Performance Analyzer

I built a comprehensive data analysis tool that processes student performance data from JSON files to generate statistical insights and identify trends across subjects and grade levels. It's designed to help educators understand student performance patterns.

## 📊 What I Built

- **Large Dataset Processing**: I made it analyze 1000+ student records efficiently
- **Multi-Subject Analysis**: I covered 5 core subjects (Math, Science, History, English, Geography)
- **Grade Level Comparison**: I built comparison across grades 1-8
- **Statistical Insights**: I created calculations for averages and identified best/worst performers
- **JSON Data Processing**: I implemented efficient handling of large JSON datasets
- **Performance Rankings**: I added identification of top and bottom performers

## 📁 How I Structured the Project

```
student-performance-solution/
├── main.py          # I put the main analysis script here
└── students/        # I created a directory containing 600+ JSON files
    ├── 0.json
    ├── 1.json
    ├── ...
    └── 599.json
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### What You'll Need
- Python 3.6+ (I used features that require this version)
- No external dependencies (I kept it simple!)

### How to Run My Analysis

```bash
cd student-performance-solution
python main.py
```

## 🎯 How I Made It Work

### Data Structure I Used
Each student record I process contains:
```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "grade": 5,
  "math": 34,
  "science": 58,
  "history": 34,
  "english": 26,
  "geography": 99
}
```

### Analysis Process I Built
1. **Load Data**: I made it read all JSON files from students directory
2. **Calculate Averages**: I programmed individual student average computation
3. **Subject Analysis**: I created subject-specific statistics
4. **Grade Analysis**: I built comparison across grade levels
5. **Ranking**: I added identification of best and worst performers

## 📈 Analysis Output I Generate

### Sample Results I Produce
```
Average Student Grade: 67.45
Hardest Subject: english
Easiest Subject: geography
Best Performing Grade: 7
Worst Performing Grade: 2
Best Student ID: 342
Worst Student ID: 156
```

### What Each Metric I Calculate Means

#### **Average Student Grade**
- I calculate the overall average across all students and subjects
- I use it to provide a baseline performance indicator

#### **Hardest/Easiest Subject**
- I base this on average scores across all students
- I use it to help identify curriculum strengths and weaknesses

#### **Best/Worst Performing Grade**
- I compare average performance by grade level
- I use it to identify developmental trends

#### **Best/Worst Student ID**
- I identify individual student performance
- I base this on overall average performance

## 🔧 Technical Details I Implemented

### Key Functions I Built

#### `load_report_card(directory, student_number)`
- I made it load individual student JSON files
- I added graceful handling of missing files
- I made it return empty dict for missing records

#### `load_report_cards(directory, num_students)`
- I built it to process all student records
- I created comprehensive dataset handling
- I made file I/O efficient

#### `add_student_averages(report_cards, subjects)`
- I calculated individual student averages
- I added "average" field to each record
- I used 5 core subjects for calculation

#### `get_average_student_grade(report_cards)`
- I computed overall class average
- I provided baseline performance metric

#### `get_subject_averages(report_cards, subjects)`
- I calculated subject-specific averages
- I identified strongest and weakest subjects

#### `get_grade_level_averages(report_cards)`
- I grouped students by grade level
- I compared performance across grades 1-8

### Data Processing Flow I Designed

```
Load JSON Files → Calculate Averages → Analyze Subjects → 
Compare Grades → Rank Students → Generate Report
```
