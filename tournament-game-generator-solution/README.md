# Tournament Game Generator

I built a tournament bracket generator that creates fair matchups based on team performance data, ensuring competitive and balanced tournament rounds. It's designed to make tournament planning easy and fair.

## 🏆 What I Built

- **Team Input Management**: I created interactive team name and performance collection
- **Performance-Based Seeding**: I built a system that ranks teams by win records
- **Fair Tournament Brackets**: I made it create balanced first-round matchups
- **Input Validation**: I added data integrity and logical constraints
- **Flexible Team Count**: I made it support any number of teams (minimum 2)
- **Game Validation**: I ensured realistic win/loss records

## 📁 How I Structured the Project

```
tournament-game-generator-solution/
└── solution_script.py    # I put the complete tournament generation logic here
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### What You'll Need
- Python 3.6+ (I used features that require this version)
- No external dependencies (I kept it simple!)

### How to Run My Generator

```bash
cd tournament-game-generator-solution
python solution_script.py
```

## 🎯 How I Made It Work

### Tournament Generation Process I Built
1. **Team Count Input**: I made it get the number of teams (minimum 2)
2. **Team Names**: I built collection of team names with validation
3. **Season Games**: I made it determine games played per team
4. **Win Records**: I created collection of win/loss data for each team
5. **Seeding**: I built ranking teams by performance
6. **Bracket Generation**: I made it create first-round matchups

### Seeding Algorithm I Implemented
- I made teams ranked by win count (ascending)
- I gave best performing teams favorable matchups
- I ensured competitive balance in tournament

## 🎮 Interactive Flow I Designed

### 1. Team Count
```
Enter the number of teams in the tournament: 8
```

### 2. Team Names
```
Enter the name for team #1: Lakers
Enter the name for team #2: Warriors
Enter the name for team #3: Celtics
Enter the name for team #4: Heat
Enter the name for team #5: Bulls
Enter the name for team #6: Knicks
Enter the name for team #7: Nets
Enter the name for team #8: Clippers
```

### 3. Season Games
```
Enter the number of games played by each team: 82
```

### 4. Win Records
```
Enter the number of wins Team Lakers had: 45
Enter the number of wins Team Warriors had: 52
Enter the number of wins Team Celtics had: 48
Enter the number of wins Team Heat had: 44
Enter the number of wins Team Bulls had: 40
Enter the number of wins Team Knicks had: 47
Enter the number of wins Team Nets had: 43
Enter the number of wins Team Clippers had: 51
```

### 5. Tournament Bracket
```
Generating the games to be played in the first round of the tournament...
Home: Bulls VS Away: Warriors
Home: Heat VS Away: Celtics
Home: Nets VS Away: Clippers
Home: Lakers VS Away: Knicks
```

## 🔧 Technical Details I Implemented

### Key Functions I Built

#### `get_number_of_teams()`
- I made it validate minimum team requirement (2+ teams)
- I ensured logical tournament structure

#### `get_team_names(num_teams)`
- I built collection of team names with validation
- I enforced naming rules (max 2 words, min 2 characters)
- I prevented duplicate team names

#### `get_number_of_games_played(num_teams)`
- I made it validate season game count
- I ensured each team plays others at least once
- I prevented impossible win records

#### `get_team_wins(team_names, games_played)`
- I built collection of win records for each team
- I validated win count against games played
- I prevented impossible statistics

### Bracket Generation Algorithm I Wrote

```python
# I sort teams by win count (ascending)
sorted_teams = sorted(team_wins, key=get_second_item)

# I generate matchups
games_to_make = len(sorted_teams) // 2
for game_num in range(games_to_make):
    home_team = sorted_teams[game_num][0]
    away_team = sorted_teams[num_teams - 1 - game_num][0]
    game_pairings.append([home_team, away_team])
```

## 🏀 Tournament Logic I Created

### Seeding Strategy I Implemented
- **Performance-Based**: I made teams ranked by win count
- **Fair Matchups**: I created best vs worst, second-best vs second-worst, etc.
- **Competitive Balance**: I ensured exciting first-round games

### Matchup Formula I Designed
- **1st Seed** vs **8th Seed**
- **2nd Seed** vs **7th Seed**
- **3rd Seed** vs **6th Seed**
- **4th Seed** vs **5th Seed**

### Example Seeding I Built
```
Rank  Team    Wins
1     Bulls    40
2     Heat     44
3     Nets     43
4     Lakers   45
5     Knicks   47
6     Celtics  48
7     Clippers 51
8     Warriors 52
```

## 🛡️ Input Validation I Built

### Team Names
- **Minimum Length**: I made it 2 characters
- **Maximum Words**: I set it at 2 words maximum
- **Format**: I used simple text input
- **Uniqueness**: I prevented duplicate team names

### Game Count
- **Minimum**: I made it ≥ (number of teams - 1)
- **Logic**: I ensured each team plays others at least once
- **Validation**: I prevented impossible win records

### Win Records
- **Range**: I made it 0 to games_played
- **Validation**: I prevented exceeding games played
- **Logic**: I ensured realistic statistics

## 📊 Tournament Features I Built

- **Minimum**: I set it at 2 teams
- **Maximum**: I made it unlimited
- **Even/Odd**: I handled both even and odd team counts
- **Scalability**: I made it work for any tournament size

### Performance Tracking

- **Home/Away**: I designated home and away teams
- **Format**: I made clear, readable output format

## 🔄 Data Flow I Designed

```
Input Team Count → Collect Team Names → Get Season Games → 
Collect Win Records → Sort by Performance → Generate Bracket → 
Display Matchups
```
